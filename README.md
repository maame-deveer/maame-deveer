### Hi ðŸ‘‹ my name is Maame De Veer
<!--**maame-deveer/maame-deveer** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.-->
As a junior engineer, I am on a journey to learn and develop innovative software solutions. My main programming language is C# because I want to explore the .net ecosystem. However, I am willing to learn new technologies and see where my programming journey takes me. With a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, I bring an unquenchable thirst to learn and grow. My story is one of aspiring to make a difference, armed with passion and a fresh outlook. I am excited to learn more and greatly improve my skills.
