I am currently working on an AR project for Googleâ€™s Immersive Geospatial Challenge hackathon and I hope I create and submit an interesting and immersive project.

### ðŸŒ± Currently Learning
I am trying to improve my understanding of C#. Also, I am working on personal projects to explore various tools while I study. I am also working on getting certifications.
